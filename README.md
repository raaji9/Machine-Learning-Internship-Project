# Machine Learning Internship Project: Online Payments Fraud Detection

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify online payment transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Using a dataset from Kaggle that includes historical transaction data, the goal is to identify patterns and features indicative of fraud. Key aspects of the project include preprocessing the data, training a classification model, and evaluating its performance to effectively detect fraudulent transactions. The final deliverable includes the project code, provided in a PDF format, demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques to enhance online payment security.

# This internship project includes both a minor and a major component:

1. Minor Project: I wrote a detailed report on "User Defined Functions in Python." The report is 7 pages long, typed, and submitted in PDF format. It delves into how user-defined functions work in Python, including their creation and practical applications.

2. Major Project: For the major project, I developed a machine learning model for Online Payment Fraud Detection. This involved classifying transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. I worked on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance to ensure it effectively detects fraud. The project, including all relevant code and findings, was submitted in PDF format as per the instructions in the attached document.
